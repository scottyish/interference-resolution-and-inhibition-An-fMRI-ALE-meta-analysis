    "    Goal of the notebook is to run a coordinate based meta analysis using NiMARE. We are using NiMARE instead of GingerALE as the GingerALE code took forever to run and even then there was a chance of it just crashing. After a search for ohter coordinate based meta analysis software we came across NiMARE, a python package that allows you to run meta-analysis. A number of people are working on this package (e.g. Tal Yarkoni) but the main contact is Taylor Salo. \n",
